# Fibonacci Sequence Analyzer

The Fibonacci Sequence Analyzer is a Python program that generates, analyzes, and visualizes properties of the Fibonacci sequence. This tool provides insights into the growth, distribution, and limiting behavior of the Fibonacci numbers.
## Features

- **Efficient Generation:** Utilizes memoization for efficient computation of Fibonacci numbers, allowing the generation of larger sequences.
- **Properties Analysis:** Analyzes and displays various properties of the Fibonacci sequence, including ratios, even/odd distribution, and prime numbers.
- **Visualization:** Generates visualizations such as line charts to illustrate the growth of Fibonacci numbers and bar charts for the distribution of even and odd numbers.
- **Limit Exploration:** Explores the limiting behavior of ratios or other properties as you generate more terms in the sequence.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kipsangmarion/Fibonacci-sequence-analyzer.git
cd fibonacci-system-analyzer
```

2. Run the main program:

Open the notebook on Jupyter Notebook, Colab or the software preferred.

Adjust parameters like `terms` or `limit` directly in the code.
